# PhoneStore

PhoneStore is my first PHP project that I built while pursuing my BCA in college.

This online platform is designed to showcase and sell a variety of cutting-edge smartphones. With a user-friendly interface and streamlined navigation, PhoneStore aims to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience, allowing them to explore an extensive selection of the latest mobile devices.
